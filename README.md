# Data Engineering Python Test


## Case - Marvel Superheroes

The main goal for Z-Tech is to help small and medium businesses to grow.

With that being said, Z-Tech is starting a new project to improve the security for these businesses by hiring a Marvel Superhero that will beat any bad guys' ass who try to rob or steal any customer from Z-Tech. 

To choose the correct hero, the Data Engineering Team has to provide for the Data Science Team a database with the list of all Marvel's heroes, with a description of the hero, and the number of times that each hero appeared in comics, series, stories and events.


## Technical Goal:

Create a dataframe in Python with all the information mentioned above, using Marvel's Characters API. The dataframe should be similar to this:



<p id="gdcalert1" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image1.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image1.png "image_tooltip")


**Requirements**:



1. Access Marvel's Developers website ([https://developer.marvel.com/](https://developer.marvel.com/)) and create an account;
2. Generate your own API Key. 
3. Study the endpoint provided by Marvel, which can be found here: [https://developer.marvel.com/docs](https://developer.marvel.com/docs).



<p id="gdcalert2" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image2.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert3">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image2.png "image_tooltip")


The python code should be sent back to Z-Tech in whatever file format you prefer. We will run your code with Databricks or Jupyter Notebook.


## Tips:



*   Feel free to use any code development tool that you prefer;
*   The authorization documentation can be found here: [https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/authorization](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/authorization);
*   One of the authorization parameters is a MD5 hash. Do not spend too much time with this logic;
*   We recommend using Postman to test your requests;
*   API's responses can be paginated when the return is too large. Pay attention to that;
*   Test it!
